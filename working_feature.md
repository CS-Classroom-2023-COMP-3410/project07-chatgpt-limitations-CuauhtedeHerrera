For Project 3:
I added 2 labels, for the player turn and score.
Then I changed the JS code to switch the labels depending on added variables such as player1Score. 
Which was done with simple if statements. 
Then I added alerts to tell the user who won

Project 6:
I changed the layout of the container such that the items could actually fit with in the screen.
Due note I couldn't make the continer fit perfectly within in the border when the screen gets smaller. This would require some media query stuff that I cannot figure out within a day.
